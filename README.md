# NYC_Taxi

### About

My project proposal is a web page that aggregates the available information on NYC nightlife that exists in the web and that uses modern data visualization and machine learning techniques to provide the user (in this case a person or group planning his night out) with the exact information they require. This includes information on trending places by neighborhood (where people are actually going), an inhouse ranking of bars and nightclubs based on a weighted average of different ratings and rankings across the web, personalized suggestions using a recommender system, etc.

For this particular exercise we process the NYC Taxi data using Google Big Query and see if an exploratory analysis can help answer wich bars are trending based on pick-ups. To regularize for outliers we are going to use monthly data :
